#BIG DATA

Dataset:

The dataset contains minute-by-minute data about temperature, humidity, air pressure and different kind of gases, collected by an air quality sensor. The raw dataset has been manipulated to add an attribute 'Activity' that can assume the values 'Meal' (class 1) or 'Other' (class 0).
    
Problem:

Given the dataset described above, train a MLP for a binary-class classification probelm. The MLP has to classify if a minute belongs to the class 'Meal' (1) or to the class 'Other' (0).
